### Description
It is a system which can monitor the real-time data of plants. The system structure can be illustrated in the following figure.
{{< figure src="structure.png" title="System Structure" >}}
The sensor nodes can collect data of plants, such as humidity, temperature and real-time photo. They can send the data to gateway by ZigBee protocol. The gateway can transfer the data to cloud server by Wi-Fi protocol. Users can view the visualized real-time data of plants in their mobile phone app remotely. Moreover, when the plants need water, this system can water the plants automatically.  
I adapted OneNET cloud platform in this system. It is a cloud platform which can provide date storage and computing service for IoT product.
### My Contribution
I was responsible for designing, coordinating, developing and testing this system. C language was mainly used. This project won third award in National College Studentsâ€™ Connected Smartest System Innovation Competition.
