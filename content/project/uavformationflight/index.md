### Description
This is my Master's thesis project. In order to understand this topic well. We illustrate it in the following picture.
{{< figure src="uav2.png" title="UAV Formation Flight In Urban Environment" >}}
In Area1, the UAVs can fly in different formations. Area2 is urban area where the UAVs can avoid buildings. It means some drones can break off from a formation and fly through urban area safely as the picture below.

In Area3, the drones can rejoin after avoiding buildings and keep flying in specific formation. During the above process, the UAVs should maximize coverage, tracking performance and minimize energy usage. It means the formation design and path planning must be optimal.
### My Contribution
This is my Master's thesis project. It is going to be finished before graduation.
