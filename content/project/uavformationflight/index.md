### Description
This is my Master's thesis project. In order to understand this topic well. We illustrate it in the following picture.
_________________________________________________________

In Area1, the UAVs can fly in different formations. Area2 is urban area where the UAVs can avoid buildings. It means some drones can break off from a formation and fly through urban area safely as the picture below.
